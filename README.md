# cl-scraper
Another Node.js web scraper with x-ray.

### Usage
`cd` into root directory and run `╰─➤ node for_sale/scraper.js` for now... (or `jobs/scraper.js`, or `services/scraper.js` etc.).
** Note: don't `cd` into category folder and run `node scraper.js` **

Will have to set up automation or at least some sort of persistence, with entry point `app.js`, at some point... :weary:
